- 👋 Hi, I’m @MaharshiPatel2274 — a Computer Science student with a focus on systems programming, full-stack development, and real-time immersive technologies.
- 👀 I’m interested in operating systems, computer networks, compiler design, cloud infrastructure, and applying AI/ML in real-world systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently expanding my knowledge in distributed systems, container orchestration (Docker/Kubernetes), and low-level memory management in C/C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on backend-intensive open-source projects, VR/AR pipelines, and dev toolchains that improve DX (Developer Experience).
- 📫 Reach me at mpate125@asu.edu or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maharshi-patel1/).
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once automated a full VR QA testing pipeline, from headset streaming to OBS recording, using Python and WebSockets.
